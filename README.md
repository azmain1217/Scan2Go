# Scan2Go
Converts external text into to machine-readable text dynamically distinguishing between phone numbers, emails, website links, and addresses.

Hovering the camera over a 10 or 11 digit phone number, the camera will automatically detect it could possibly represent a phone number and immediately present to you, your default Phone application or if a list of applications if you have more apps that can open phone numbers.

Bringing a website link over text that includes "http://" or "www." with an ending of ".com" will automatically detect it is a website and take you directly to your default web browser on your phone.
